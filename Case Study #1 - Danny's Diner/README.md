## Question and Solution
**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT 
    s.customer_id, 
    SUM(m.price) AS total_sales
FROM 
    dannys_diner.sales s
JOIN 
    dannys_diner.menu m 
    ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY 
    s.customer_id
ORDER BY 
    s.customer_id ASC;
````


  #### üß© Basic Steps
- Join sales and menu tables on product_id to include price details.
- Select customer_id and calculate total using SUM(m.price).
- Group records by customer_id to aggregate totals per customer.

  #### Answer:
| customer_id | total_sales |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

- Customer A spent $76.
- Customer B spent $74.
- Customer C spent $36.

**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**
````sql
SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS visit_count
FROM dannys_diner.sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
````
#### üß© Basic Steps
- Select customer_id and count the number of distinct visit dates using COUNT(DISTINCT order_date).
- This gives the number of unique days each customer visited.
- Use GROUP BY customer_id to calculate this count for each customer separately.

  #### Answer:
| customer_id | visit_count |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 4          |
| B           | 6          |
| C           | 2          |

- Customer A visited 4 times.
- Customer B visited 6 times.
- Customer C visited 2 times.

***

**3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**
````sql
WITH first_item_purchased AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id, 
    s.order_date, 
    m.product_name, 
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date ASC) AS first_item
  FROM dannys_diner.sales s
  JOIN dannys_diner.menu m 
    ON s.product_id = m.product_id
  GROUP BY s.customer_id, s.order_date, m.product_name
)
SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  product_name 
FROM first_item_purchased
WHERE first_item = 1;
````

#### üß© Basic Steps
- Create a CTE to identify the first item(s) each customer purchased.
- Join sales and menu tables to get the product name.
- Use RANK() to order purchases by date for each customer.
- Filter rows where the rank is 1 to get the first purchase(s).
- Select customer_id and product_name as final output.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | curry        | 
| A           | sushi        | 
| B           | curry        |

**4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**
````sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(s.product_id) AS items_purchased, 
  m.product_name
FROM dannys_diner.sales s
JOIN dannys_diner.menu m 
  ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY m.product_name
ORDER BY items_purchased DESC
LIMIT 1;
````

#### üß© Basic Steps
- Join sales and menu tables using product_id to get product names for each sale.
- Count how many times each product was sold using COUNT(s.product_id).
- Group results by product_name to get item-wise sales count.
- Order the results in descending order of items_purchased.
- Use LIMIT 1 to get the most purchased menu item.

  #### Answer:
| items_purchased | product_name | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 8       | ramen |


- Most purchased item on the menu is ramen which is 8 times.

  ***

**5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?**
````sql
with most_popular_item as(
Select s.customer_id, m.product_name,  COUNT(m.product_id) AS order_count,
rank()over(partition by customer_id order by count(s.customer_id) desc) as  most_popular
from dannys_diner.sales s 
join dannys_diner.menu m on s.product_id = m.product_id
group by s.customer_id, m.product_name
order by customer_id,most_popular desc)
select customer_id, product_name, order_count
from most_popular_item
where most_popular = 1
````

#### üß© Basic Steps
Join sales and menu tables using product_id.
Group the data by both customer_id and product_name.
Count how many times each customer ordered each product (order_count).
Use RANK() to assign a popularity rank per customer, sorted by descending order count.
Filter only those rows where the rank is 1, indicating each customer‚Äôs most frequently ordered item.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name | order_count |
| ----------- | ---------- |------------  |
| A           | ramen        |  3   |
| B           | sushi        |  2   |
| B           | curry        |  2   |
| B           | ramen        |  2   |
| C           | ramen        |  3   |

- Customer A and C's favourite item is ramen.
- Customer B enjoys all items on the menu.

**6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?**
````sql
WITH first_item_purchased AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id, 
    s.order_date, 
    m.join_date, 
    mn.product_name,
    RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY s.customer_id 
      ORDER BY s.order_date ASC
    ) AS rank
  FROM dannys_diner.sales s
  JOIN dannys_diner.members m 
    ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
  JOIN dannys_diner.menu mn 
    ON s.product_id = mn.product_id
  WHERE m.join_date < s.order_date
  GROUP BY s.customer_id, s.order_date, m.join_date, mn.product_name
)
SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  product_name
FROM first_item_purchased
WHERE rank = 1;
````
#### üß© Basic Steps
- Join sales, members, and menu tables using appropriate keys.
- Filter only those purchases that occurred after a customer became a member.
- Use RANK() to assign a rank to each product ordered after membership, sorted by earliest order_date for each customer.
- Select only the products where rank = 1, i.e., the first item purchased after becoming a member.
- Return the customer_id and the corresponding product_name.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | ramen        |
| B           | sushi        |

- Customer A's first order as a member is ramen.
- Customer B's first order as a member is sushi.

  **7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?**
````sql
  WITH first_item_purchased AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id, 
    s.order_date, 
    m.join_date, 
    mn.product_name,
    RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY s.customer_id 
      ORDER BY s.order_date DESC
    ) AS rank
  FROM dannys_diner.sales s
  JOIN dannys_diner.members m 
    ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
  JOIN dannys_diner.menu mn 
    ON s.product_id = mn.product_id
  WHERE m.join_date > s.order_date
  GROUP BY 
    s.customer_id, 
    m.customer_id, 
    s.order_date, 
    m.join_date, 
    mn.product_name
)
SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  product_name
FROM first_item_purchased
WHERE rank = 1;
````

#### üß© Basic Steps
- Joins sales, members, and menu tables to associate customer purchases with membership details and product names.
- Filters for transactions that happened before a customer became a member (join_date > order_date).
- Uses RANK() to rank the purchases in reverse order (latest first) before membership for each customer.
- Retrieves the most recent item purchased before membership activation (rank = 1).
- Final output shows customer_id and product_name.

  #### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | sushi        |
| A           | curry        |
| B           | sushi        |

- Both customers' last order before becoming members are sushi.However A has ordered "curry" on the same date.

**8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?**
````sql
WITH total_item_amount AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id, 
    m.product_name,  
    SUM(m.price) AS price, 
    mn.join_date,  
    s.order_date
  FROM dannys_diner.sales s 
  JOIN dannys_diner.menu m 
    ON s.product_id = m.product_id
  JOIN dannys_diner.members mn 
    ON s.customer_id = mn.customer_id
  WHERE mn.join_date > s.order_date
  GROUP BY 
    s.customer_id, 
    m.product_name, 
    mn.join_date,  
    s.order_date
  ORDER BY s.customer_id ASC
)
SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  COUNT(product_name) AS total_items, 
  SUM(price) AS amount_spent
FROM total_item_amount
GROUP BY customer_id;
````
#### üß© Basic Steps
- CTE (total_item_amount): Joins sales, menu, and members tables.
- Filters records before the customer became a member (join_date > order_date).
- Counts how many distinct items the customer bought (COUNT(product_name)).
- Sums the total amount spent on those items (SUM(price)).
- Groups result by customer to get summary per user.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_items | amount_spent |
| ----------- | ---------- |----------  |
| A           | 2 |  25       |
| B           | 3 |  40       |

Before becoming members,
- Customer A spent $25 on 2 items.
- Customer B spent $40 on 3 items.

***

**9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier ‚Äî how many points would each customer have?**

```sql
SELECT 
  s.customer_id,
  SUM(
    CASE 
      WHEN product_name = 'sushi' THEN m.price * 20
      ELSE m.price * 10 
    END
  ) AS total_points
FROM dannys_diner.sales s
JOIN dannys_diner.menu m 
  ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY s.customer_id;
```
#### üß© Basic Steps
- Goal: Calculate total loyalty points per customer.
- Points logic:
-     If the item is sushi, award 20 points per price unit.
-     For all other items, award 10 points per price unit.
- Uses a CASE statement inside SUM() to apply the logic per product.
- Joins sales with menu to access product_name and price.
- Groups by customer_id to get a per-customer summary.
- Orders the final output by customer_id in ascending order.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_points | 
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | 860 |
| B           | 940 |
| C           | 360 |

- Total points for Customer A is $860.
- Total points for Customer B is $940.
- Total points for Customer C is $360.

**10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi ‚Äî how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?**

```sql
WITH dates_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id, 
      join_date, 
      join_date + 6 AS valid_date, 
      DATE_TRUNC(
        'month', '2021-01-31'::DATE)
        + interval '1 month' 
        - interval '1 day' AS last_date
  FROM dannys_diner.members
)

SELECT 
  sales.customer_id, 
  SUM(CASE
    WHEN menu.product_name = 'sushi' THEN 2 * 10 * menu.price
    WHEN sales.order_date BETWEEN dates.join_date AND dates.valid_date THEN 2 * 10 * menu.price
    ELSE 10 * menu.price END) AS points
FROM dannys_diner.sales
INNER JOIN dates_cte AS dates
  ON sales.customer_id = dates.customer_id
  AND dates.join_date <= sales.order_date
  AND sales.order_date <= dates.last_date
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id;
```

#### Steps:
- A CTE is used to calculate each member‚Äôs 7-day loyalty window by adding 6 days to their join date.
- The query joins the sales, menu, and the CTE (members) tables using customer_id and product_id.
- It filters orders to include only those placed between the customer‚Äôs join date and 2021-01-31.
- Points are assigned based on the purchase date and item:
    - If the purchase is within the 7-day program window: price √ó 10 √ó 2.
    - If the purchase is outside the program window and the item is ‚Äòsushi‚Äô: price √ó 10 √ó 2.
    - If the purchase is outside the window and not sushi: price √ó 10.
- The total points are summed per customer.
- The final output lists each customer_id with their customer_points, sorted by customer_id.


#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_points | 
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | 1020 |
| B           | 320 |

- Total points for Customer A is 1,020.
- Total points for Customer B is 320.
