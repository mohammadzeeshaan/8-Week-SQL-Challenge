## 🧠 Summary of the Problem Statement (Danny’s Diner)
Danny wants to analyze his restaurant’s customer data to gain insights into customer visit patterns, spending habits, and favorite menu items. These insights will help him improve customer experience and decide whether to expand his loyalty program. He also needs help preparing easy-to-use datasets for non-SQL users. Danny has shared sample data from three tables: sales, menu, and members for this analysis.
