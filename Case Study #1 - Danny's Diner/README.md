## Question and Solution
**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT 
    s.customer_id, 
    SUM(m.price) AS total_sales
FROM 
    dannys_diner.sales s
JOIN 
    dannys_diner.menu m 
    ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY 
    s.customer_id
ORDER BY 
    s.customer_id ASC;
````


  #### üß© Basic Steps
- Join sales and menu tables on product_id to include price details.
- Select customer_id and calculate total using SUM(m.price).
- Group records by customer_id to aggregate totals per customer.

  #### Answer:

| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |
